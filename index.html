	  <div id="innit"><p><strong>My goal was to have fun with <i>dynamics</i>. I looked through SM, and "Jean Baptist-Arban Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet". What a mouthful. In the beginning I wasn't able to smoothly transition. I took my time, practicing 15 minutes (twice) a day. Close to 3 days in, I noticed a difference. I could go from pianissimo (pp) to fortissimo (ff). Kinda hope that is spelled right. I reached a 4 because it's not perfect. Oh well. I'm not performing because I'm in SCHOOL. Next goal-30 mins a day, everyday, no exeptions.</strong></p></div>
